Description             : This project is something I have been working on in an
                          attempt to get into Boom wadding. This is version 0.2,
                          which consists of just two maps - MAP01, and MAP02.  
						  
                          The first level is somewhat forgiving, though the 
                          difficulty does ramp up as you progress. 
						  
                          The second level can be played continuously after the
                          first, but if you want a challenge then try it with a
                          pistol start.
