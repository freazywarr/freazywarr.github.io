	<h1>GZFREAZY.wad - <i>Freazy's Ultimate Doom Recreation for GZDoom v0.1</i></h1>
	<p>I can't remember when I started work on this wad, but if I had to guess, I would probably say it started in about August 2021. If you've played the first episode of Ultimate Doom, and you likely have, then you'll recognise the general layouts of these maps. However, I've added several GZDoom exclusive mechanics and made them more difficult.</p>
	<p>My motivation for recreating Knee-Deep in the Dead was to allow me to study the original Doom episode as a mapper. Making the wad for GZDoom allowed me to practice using advanced features, as well as giving me a chance to apply my ACS library to an actual map. </p>
	<p>You will need <a href="https://www.zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom</a> to play this wad. You will also need a copy of Doom 2 which you can buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/doom_ii_final_doom">GOG</a>.</p>

Title                   : Freazy's Ultimate Doom Recreation for GZDoom v0.1
Filename                : GZFREAZY.WAD
Release date            : 14/02/22
Author                  : Freazy Warr
Email Address           : doom@freazywarr.com

Description             : This project is something I have been working on in an
                          attempt to learn the more advanced features of GZDoom. 
                          This is version 0.1, which consists of two maps - E1M1 
                          and E1M2.  
                          
                          This wad currently only has three difficulties, though
                          one simply removes monsters. I may add more 
                          difficulties in the future.
                          
                          An ACS Library can be found inside the lump. It
                          contains the code for the breakable windows and the 
                          monster spawners. This library is currently
                          undocumented but you may use it if you want.
                          
                          This wad requires jumping, crouching, and freelook
                          to be enabled.
