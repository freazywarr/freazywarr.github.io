Description             : This project is something I have been working on in an
                          attempt to learn the more advanced features of GZDoom. 
                          This is version 0.1, which consists of two maps - E1M1 
                          and E1M2.  
                          
                          This wad currently only has three difficulties, though
                          one simply removes monsters. I may add more 
                          difficulties in the future.
                          
                          An ACS Library can be found inside the lump. It
                          contains the code for the breakable windows and the 
                          monster spawners. This library is currently
                          undocumented but you may use it if you want.
                          
                          This wad requires jumping, crouching, and freelook
                          to be enabled.
