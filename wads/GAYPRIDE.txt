Description             : Each wad in this collection changes the status bar to
                          a different pride flag. Each edit has been made with 
                          Doom's limited colour palette and should be widely 
                          compatible.

                          I have not added every pride flag. Some flags use 
                          colours which makes them incompatible with Doom's 
                          limited colour palette. Other flags are too complex 
                          for the size or position of the flag.  

                          Feel free to download, edit, and share these edits.

                          Only load one of these wads at a time, and make sure 
                          to put them at the end of your load order.
