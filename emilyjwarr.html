		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		Hi, I'm Emily Jules Warr. <br>
		I'm an undergraduate studying English Literature at Anglia Ruskin University who so happens to also make video games. 
		I would probably spend more time doing the latter if I wasn’t so afraid of money. Money to pay for rent, food, electricity, internet, etc. 
		In retrospect, studying English Literature probably doesn’t help me to earn money either.
