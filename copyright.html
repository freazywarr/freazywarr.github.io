		<h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
		<p>
		It is my sincere belief that copyright, in its current form, has hindered our collective cultural development.
		<br>
		<br>
		The supposed benefit of copyright has always been to allow artists to profit from their works without competition. The spirit of this, however, has clearly been undermined by the capitalist desire to extend the duration of copyright for the sole desire of profit.
		<br>
		<br>
		Modern copyright, for the UK at least, lasts for the period of 70 years after the authors death. How, then, is anyone in the lifetime of a works publication supposed to build from this?
		<br>
		<br>
		There is plenty of literature which explains the issues of copyright, and plenty more literature that offers alternatives. This webpage is merely a short explanation for my sites copyright policy.
