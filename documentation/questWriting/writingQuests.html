		<h2>Writing Quests</h2>
		<p>When writing a story with branching paths it is best to plan first.
		 Understanding what the story is first is a necessity, however this page will not go over that.
		 Instead, this page will be for explaining the process of turning a branching story idea into a proper plan.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Drawing flow charts is a good way planning out a branching story.
		 The table below contains all of the boxes I use when drawing these flow charts</p>
		
		<table style="100%">
			<tr>
				<th>Box Type</th>
				<th>Box Purpose</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="flowDemo1.png" alt="Location / Time Information"></td>
				<td><p>This box is for describing what location the player is in and at what time.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="flowDemo2.png" alt="Player Input / Game Output"></td>
				<td><p>This box is used for describing a player input or a games output.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="flowDemo3.png" alt="Game Condition"></td>
				<td><p>This box is for in-game conditionals, namely <i>if</i> statements.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="flowDemo4.png" alt="Start / End of Quest"></td>
				<td><p>This box indicates whether a quest has started or finished.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="flowDemo5.png" alt="Player Process / Game Process"></td>
				<td><p>This box describes an action the game or player has to do in order to continue.</p></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>The following is a flowchart showing a simple quest which has been made using the rules from the table above.
		 The arrows show the direction of time.</p>
		<img src="flowchartExample.png" alt="An example flowchart of the quest design.">
		<p>In that example there are two locations and three NPC&#8217;s. Each NPC requires a flowchart for every location they are in.
		 In this example, the NPC&#8217;s do not change location, so they will only require one flowchart each.</p>
