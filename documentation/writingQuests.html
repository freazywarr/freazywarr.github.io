	<h2>Writing Quests</h2>
	<p>When writing a story with branching paths it is best to plan first. Understanding what the story is first is a necessity, however this page will not go over that. Instead, this page will be for explaining the process of turning a branching story idea into a proper plan.</p>

	<p>Drawing flow charts is a good way planning out a branching story. The table below contains all of the boxes I use when drawing these flow charts</p>
		
	<table style="100%">
		<tr>
			<th>Box Type</th>
			<th>Box Purpose</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="./writingQuests/flowDemo1.png" alt="Location / Time Information"></td>
			<td>This box is for describing what location the player is in and at what time.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="./writingQuests/flowDemo2.png" alt="Player Input / Game Output"></td>
			<td>This box is used for describing a player input or a games output.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="./writingQuests/flowDemo3.png" alt="Game Condition"></td>
			<td>This box is for in-game conditionals, namely <i>if</i> statements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="./writingQuests/flowDemo4.png" alt="Start / End of Quest"></td>
			<td>This box indicates whether a quest has started or finished.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="./writingQuests/flowDemo5.png" alt="Player Process / Game Process"></td>
			<td>This box describes an action the game or player has to do in order to continue.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
		
	<p>The following is a flowchart showing a simple quest which has been made using the rules from the table above. The arrows show the direction of time.</p>
	<img src="./writingQuests/flowchartExample.png" alt="An example flowchart of the quest design.">
	<p>In that example there are two locations and three NPC&#8217;s. Each NPC requires a flowchart for every location they are in. In this example, the NPC&#8217;s do not change location, so they will only require one flowchart each.</p>
		
	<p>The following is a flowchart for dialogue with the players friend outside of the shop.</p>
